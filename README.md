## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer model for translating English sentences to Spanish. The underlying architecture is based on the Transformer model proposed by Vaswani et al. ([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).

To get started, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. The project is developed using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers. Install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch
pip install transformers
